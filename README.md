al\_eth out-of-tree driver
==========================

`al_eth` is the driver for Amazon Annapurna Labs' Alpine NIC. Alpine SoCs are
used in a few consumer products, including some QNAP NAS appliances. This
driver source code was extracted from a Linux kernel source drop from QNAP.

The original source code was designed for Linux 4.2.8. The version in this
repository has only been tested with Linux 5.5.5.
